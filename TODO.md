# TODO

Follow-up backlog after the initial Python format-and-lint tooling rollout.

## Format-And-Lint Follow-Up

- Rerun `zwm lint check` after the `research-progress-bar` cleanup and reassess whether `max-complexity = 25` should stay as-is or be tightened further.

## General Refactor Backlog

- Broad runtime splitting for `research-progress-bar` is mostly complete; only reopen it if `mods/research-progress-bar/src/zanju_rpb/main.py` or `mods/research-progress-bar/src/zanju_rpb/scaleform/modes.py` grow enough to justify another targeted slice.

## CI / Toolchain Backlog

- Restore a "WoT is running" guard for deploy/cleanup/cycle. It was removed in the Docker migration because a Linux container can't enumerate Windows host processes (`tasklist`). Viable options: (a) a host **PowerShell** wrapper that runs the `tasklist` check before invoking the container (no install needed — PowerShell is built in); (b) a file-lock probe on a known WoT-held file; (c) a `--force`/`--skip-running-check` opt-out if a host check is reintroduced. Until then, deploy relies on file-lock `PermissionError` handling (in-use files are skipped) — close WoT manually.

## Release And Distribution Backlog

- Add a `research-progress-bar` release checklist for wgmods.net and modpack submission: standalone companion bundle contents, config/i18n copy requirements, no-optional-UI-API smoke test, and re-test expectations for each WoT version even when no code change is planned.
- Resolved: `meta.xml` stays in releases, trimmed to the spec fields `id`/`version`/`name`/`description`. The Wargaming *Mod Packages* spec marks it optional (only `res/` is required) but `id`/`version` give clean load-order and same-id version de-dup, so keeping it is worthwhile. It is now the single source of truth for those values (build generates the runtime `_mod_meta` and all scripts read it via `tools/mod_meta.py`).

## Localization / Font Coverage

- Current state: text outside the embedded Roboto Mono range (Korean, Greek, Cyrillic, etc.) falls back to the `Malgun Gothic` device font. This is wired centrally through `ResearchProgressBarFonts.setText` / `setHtmlText`, so every text field — tooltips, mode buttons, counters, markers, status line — picks it up. Fixes issue #3 (Korean) and covers European scripts.
- Gap: Malgun Gothic does not cover Japanese (kana/kanji), Chinese (Han), Thai, Arabic, or Hebrew, which still render as boxes. WoT ships clients in several of those languages, but no single guaranteed-present Windows font covers all of CJK.
- Universal fix to investigate: instead of hardcoding an OS font, point the fallback at one of WoT's own registered Scaleform fonts (GFx `$`-prefixed, e.g. `$FieldFont`), whose per-locale glyph fallback Wargaming already configures. GFx would then resolve whatever the active client language needs, covering every WoT-supported language at once — the genuinely universal solution.
- Why it is not a quick swap: the code change is one line (`FALLBACK_FONT_NAME` in `ResearchProgressBarFonts.as`, now centralized), but the validation is the real work:
  - Confirm the exact WoT font name in-game; it may differ between client versions.
  - Verify a mod-loaded SWF can resolve WoT's `$`-named GFx fonts from its own context.
  - `embedFonts` semantics differ for GFx font-lib fonts (likely `embedFonts = true` with the `$` name, not the `embedFonts = false` device-font path used for Malgun Gothic).
  - Add a graceful chain (WoT font -> Malgun Gothic -> `_sans`) so a wrong/missing name degrades instead of showing boxes.
  - Needs an in-game test cycle per target language.
- Keep the Malgun Gothic fallback as the shipped baseline until the WoT-font approach is validated.

## Research Progress Bar Dynamic Coloring

- Done so far: marker **icons**, Field Mods **level labels**, and tooltip **prerequisite icons** are recoloured at runtime to their marker's state via a single per-state colour table in `ResearchProgressBarIconTint.as` (multiply `ColorTransform` on each `Bitmap`, not the shared `BitmapData`; prestige badges excluded). The exact-vs-brighter design question is settled as **exact dash colour** (constants sampled from the dash PNGs: default `0x9CA4AB`, green `0x9CCB68`, yellow `0xE4B55A`, white `0xF6F1E7`).
- Follow-up: extend the same runtime tint to the **marker dashes** and the **progress-bar fills**, retiring the per-colour PNGs so the whole bar's palette lives in one code table.
  - **Marker dashes (4 → 1):** `marker_default/green/yellow/white.png` (4×14) share a pixel-identical alpha; they differ only in hue. Collapse to one greyscale master tinted per `markerState` in `ResearchProgressBarMarkers.createMarkerBitmap`. `marker_white` already works as the near-white master (white = identity tint). The four tint colours are the same constants already in `ResearchProgressBarIconTint`.
  - **Progress-bar fills (4 → 2):** `progress_bar_green/yellow/white.png` (80×8) share an identical alpha (full rect), hue-only difference → one greyscale master. `progress_bar_base.png` has a **different** alpha (the empty track) → keep it a separate asset. The three colour fills are stacked (`ResearchProgressBarViewFactory` lines ~66-73) but each is masked to a **disjoint** horizontal slice (`completedMaskShape`/`combatMaskShape`/`freeMaskShape`), so they never blend — keep the three `Bitmap` instances, embed the one master, and apply a **different `ColorTransform` per instance**; masks stay untouched.
  - Both plug into the existing `ResearchProgressBarIconTint` colour table (single source of truth); build a shared `tintBitmap(bitmap, color)` helper so dashes and fills reuse the icon path.
  - Caveat: multiply-tint needs a near-white master; if a specific green/yellow must read deeper than `white × tint` can reach, that one master needs a brightness lift (same as the filter-icon pass).
- Verifier: `scratchpad/png_probe.py` (pure-Python PNG decoder, no PIL) reports per-variant alpha match / hue / peak and samples dash peak RGB — rerun it if the assets change before wiring.

## Research Progress Bar Guardrails

- Fix the garage layering / z-index issue between the mod UI and the filters window; some mod tooltips still render below foreground elements.
- Evaluate whether tank research totals should include the cost of prerequisite modules before a tank unlock.
- Check which upgrade is actually reachable right now and list all currently missing upgrades.
- Turn `research-progress-bar` `configVersion` into a real migration hook: add versioned forward migrations, defaults for new keys, and pruning for renamed/removed keys instead of only carrying `configVersion = 1` forward on save.
- Out of scope unless explicitly requested: changing mode semantics.
- Out of scope unless explicitly requested: redesigning the Scaleform layout.
- Out of scope unless explicitly requested: removing the production garage visibility-probe behavior.
- Future AS3 naming/package cleanup: build a second fake test mod and use it to collision-test default-package class names, helper names, and source/output path overlap before renaming `ResearchProgressBar*.as` files or introducing an AS3 package tree; the earlier unique-path finding justifies this test method, but file-path collisions and class-name collisions need to be validated separately.
- Future refactor guardrail: treat reflective prestige/elite adapter helpers in `zanju_rpb.main` as load-bearing runtime-contract code, not obvious dead code; before deleting or simplifying them, validate in-game across elite non-tier XI vehicles, tier XI vehicles, `eliteMode=customization_only`, and repeated vehicle switches.
