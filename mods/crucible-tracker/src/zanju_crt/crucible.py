"""What the banner, the card and the battle panel show, worked out from plain data.

The client calls the Crucible "challenges". A challenge is one series of missions. The player
activates one series at a time, plays its missions in order, and loses a shield on each failed
battle. The account tokens hold the progress of each series:

    challenge:quest:<id>    the number of the current mission, from 1
    challenge:attempt:<id>  the shields left
    challenge:win:<id>      how many times the series was completed

collector reads the client and hands this module plain dictionaries, so everything here can be
tested outside the game.

The conditions of a mission arrive as the client stores them: a list of (name, value) pairs,
nested. A leaf is a list with one ("value", x) pair. For example, "cause 3,500 HP of damage or
destroy 3 vehicles" is:

    [('or', [('results', [('key', [('value', 'damageDealt')]), ('greaterOrEqual', [('value', 3500.0)])]),
             ('results', [('key', [('value', 'kills')]), ('greaterOrEqual', [('value', 3.0)])])])]
