"""The progress of the current Crucible mission in one battle, from plain facts.

battle_session reads the client and hands this module plain numbers: a hit, a kill, the HP of the
player's vehicle, the start of the battle. The tracker turns them into the progress of each
condition, in the order of `crucible.condition_sets`. It has no client imports, so the tests run
it outside the game.

The server decides the mission from the battle results. The panel can only follow the events that
the client sees, so the figures here are an estimate. What each figure comes from, and where it
can differ from the result, is in docs/reference/crucible.md.
